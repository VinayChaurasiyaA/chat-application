Spring implemtation initially we implemented using webSocket
WebSocket is a communication protocol that makes it possible to establish a two-way communication channel between a server and a client.
WebSocket works by first establishing a regular HTTP connection with the server and then upgrading it to a bidirectional websocket connection by sending an Upgrade header.
WebSocket is supported in most modern web browsers and for browsers that donâ€™t support it, we have libraries that provide fallbacks to other techniques like comet and long-polling.
